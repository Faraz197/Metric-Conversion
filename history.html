                        <p>The concept of area measurement was not invented by a single individual but evolved over time. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans contributed to the understanding of area measurement. The modern unit of area, the <b>square meter (m²)</b>, was standardized during the <b>French Revolution</b> in the 18th century, largely driven by the efforts of French scientists and mathematicians.</p>

                        <h2>How it was invented.</h2>
                        <p>The invention of area measurement began with practical needs, such as land division and agriculture, in ancient civilizations. Early units were based on body measurements (like the cubit). Over time, mathematicians such as <b>Euclid</b> developed geometric principles for calculating area. The <b>metric system</b>, introduced by the French in the late 18th century, formally standardized the square meter as the unit of area, creating consistency for scientific and practical use worldwide.</p>

The earliest standardized length units were created by the <b>Egyptians</b> and <b>Mesopotamians</b>. However, the modern unit of length, the <b>meter</b>, was officially defined by French scientists during the <b>French Revolution</b> in the late 18th century.</p>

As civilizations grew, so did the need for standardized measurements. In 1791, French scientists defined the <b>meter</b> as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole, providing a universal and precise method for measuring length. This became the foundation of the <b>metric system</b>, which standardized length measurement globally.</p>
